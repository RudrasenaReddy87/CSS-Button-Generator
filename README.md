## ðŸŽ¯ Project Description

**CSS Button Generator** is a modern, fully responsive web application built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Tailwind CSS**, designed to showcase a curated collection of beautiful and interactive CSS buttons. Each button is implemented as a reusable React component and styled independently, allowing for modular updates and easy contributions.

This project is ideal for frontend developers, designers, and enthusiasts looking for inspiration or ready-to-use button styles for their web projects. It features a gallery layout, live previews, copy-to-clipboard functionality, and is optimized for both desktop and mobile experiences.

Users can also submit their own button designs, making it a collaborative space for UI creativity.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
